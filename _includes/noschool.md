#### No School Camp December 20, 2012 and January 2, 2013

MCHD December and January camps may be just the thing you need to help with child care or give you extra time to prepare for or recover from a busy winter schedule!

Our theme for both camps is "Light and Shadow," in acknowledgement of the physical world transition between shorter periods of light and longer periods of day, and the many cultural traditions honoring these transitions at this time of year.
