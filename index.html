      <h2>Celebrating 37 Years!</h2>
      <p>Montessori Children’s House of Durham (MCHD) lays foundations
      for intellectual, moral, emotional, physical, social, and
      spiritual competence in our students. We shape young people who
      have a sense of the grand order of the universe, who can assume
      their rights and responsibilities, find joy in learning, and who
      delight among the peoples and in the places where they live.</p>
      <p>To accomplish these goals, MCHD implements classic Montessori
      principles of respect for the child’s capabilities, preparation of
      the environment in which the child can be successful, and
      observation of each learner’s style and progress.</p>
      <p>Founded in 1976, MCHD became the first school in NC to be
      Accredited by the American Montessori Society, in 1996.</p>
