            <p>Our primary entry level for new students is at 3 years old, but we admit students 18-36 months old for Toddler classes, and generally have openings for 4&ndash; and 5-year-olds and elementary-age students each year.</p>
            <p>MCHD offers you several ways to get to know our school and the Montessori method, and to meet our faculty.</p>
            <h6>Information Sessions NEW!</h6>

            <h6>Classroom Observations</h6>
            <p>Beginning mid-November  of each school year, MCHD welcomes you to observe in our classrooms. An observation provides the best way to see Montessori education in action as practiced at MCHD, and is a required part of the application process. We recommend that you plan to be in the classroom for an hour, and we ask that you do not bring children with you. After your observation, you will be able to meet with the Head of School to answer any questions about the school or the admissions process.</p>
            <p>Optimal times for observations for Early Childhood and Extended Day are Monday - Friday beginning at 9:00 or 9:30 am; for Elementary, Monday - Thursday between 8:30 and 11am; and for Toddler, daily at 9:15 am.</p>
            <p><em>Please call us at (919) 489-9045 to schedule a visit.</em></p>
            <h6>Open House</h6>
            <p>MCHD hosts one Open House each year. Our next Open House will be January 12, 2014 from 3 to 5 p.m. Families are welcome to arrive at any time during that period, but be sure to give yourself enough time to walk through classrooms at different program levels, speak with teachers, and meet current parents. Though children are welcome to attend, we recommend that you consider making other arrangements so that you can have extended conversations while you&rsquo;re here.</p>
            <h6>American Montessori Society</h6>
            <p>The American Montessori Society provides information about Montessori education to parents. Visit their website at <a href="http://www.amshq.org/" target="_blank">www.amshq.org</a>.</p>

            <p>We accept applications at any time of the year, for any future school year. After re-enrollment of our current families in February, new students are admitted from the applicant pool to balance our classes by age, gender, and to create a diverse community.</p>
            <p>To be considered in the first round of admissions (recommended), please have your application in our office by <strong><em>January 31st for Toddler, Early Childhood, and Extended Day</em>. </strong>Families who apply by this date will be notified by early March about their acceptance.&nbsp; Applicants for elementary grades are also encouraged to apply early.</p>
            <p>Should you face an offer deadline from another school before you hear from us, please call and inquire as to the status of your application.</p>
            <p>After the first round of admissions, there may still be spaces available for the upcoming school year, and <em><strong>new applications will continue to be accepted after January 31st,</strong></em>&nbsp; especially for older children.</p>
            <p>Applicants will be admitted from the waiting pool to balance age, gender, and diversity of each class.</p>
            <p>When your child is admitted, you will be sent a tuition contract along with your offer letter. You will then have seven days to secure your child&rsquo;s place by signing the contract and paying the Acceptance Fee (see <a href="tuition.html#tuition">Tuition</a>). </p>
            <p><em>Applications may be mailed to 2800 Pickett Road Durham NC 27705.</em></p>

          <p class="title" data-section-title><a href="#orientation">New Student Orientation</a></p>
          <div class="content" data-slug="orientation" data-section-content>
            <p>It is the goal of MCHD that all new students become comfortable in their new surroundings as soon as possible, and that this transition is as gentle and supportive as possible. In the tradition of Montessori education, we believe in preparation of the child for new experiences and tasks.</p>
            <h5>Early Childhood  and Extended Day</h5>
            <p>Just prior to the first week of orientation, your child&rsquo;s teacher will call to set up an appointment for an individual meeting with you and your child in the classroom. This half-hour visit presents a chance for your child to see the classroom, meet his or her teachers one on one, while parents are still present. The objective is to make that initial introduction in a quiet, calm atmosphere, without simultaneously separating from parents.</p>
            <p>During the following two weeks, new students come for a short morning, from 8:30 to 10:15 a.m. With only new students in attendance, class size is about 7-8 students, enabling the two teachers to give lots of attention to each child. The room is quiet and calm, and children get settled into knowing where the bathroom is, coming to group time for a short song and brief lesson, and how to engage in the cycle of work activity.</p>
            <p>The second week of orientation returning students arrive for the second half of the morning, after the new students have gone home or to our After School Program. This gives those older children a chance to renew their friendships after a long summer, and settle back into classroom routines.</p>
            <p>Finally the class is joined together for the regular full morning schedule, traditionally the day after Labor Day. Remarkably, the new students have already bonded with their teachers and their community, and by then most feel they have found a new home and friends. The teachers continue to give focused attention to the children who are still in process with entering a new environment.</p>
            <p>Children entering MCHD as new students at the Extended Day level will attend with other new students during Orientation Week 1, and with returning students (more their age peers) during Orientation Week 2.</p>
            <h5>Toddler</h5>
            <p>For students 18 months to 3 years old entering this class, the teacher will arrange a home visit prior to the start of school, in order to make the child&rsquo;s acquaintance in a familiar and safe environment.</p>
            <p>New students will come to school for the first two or more weeks on a shortened schedule. The first day is &quot;Visiting Day&quot; and a parent or trusted other caregiver accompanies the child into the classroom. On this day, children have the freedom to explore their new school environment with a loved one present to provide reassurance as needed and to act as a beacon of familiarity to which the child can return until the teachers and the environment itself are familiar. Subsequently, the parent or caregiver stays close by but out of sight, in case the child is having a markedly difficult time adjusting, until the child is ready for independence.</p>
            <h5>Elementary</h5>
            <p>All first and fourth graders, and any elementary student new to MCHD in any grade, will attend a week or so of half-day orientation before returning students join them for the start of the regular schedule.</p>
            <p>Please see our<a href="http://mchdurham.org/calendars/2013-14&#32;Orientation&#32;Only&#32;Calendar.pdf">Orientation calendar</a>(not including Toddler) for the orientation schedule for 2013-2014.</p>

          <p class="title" data-section-title><a href="#faqs">FAQs</a></p>
          <div class="content" data-slug="faqs" data-section-content>
                <h6>What&rsquo;s the primary entry age for your school?</h6>
                <p>We have the most openings for children who are three or four by September 1st each year, as we have more Preschool classes than any other. We admit children who are between 18 months and 3 years old into the Pre-Three class, and generally admit some older students from kindergarten through the elementary grades each year. In the higher grades, we mostly admit Montessori transfer students.</p>
                <h6>What is the application deadline?</h6>
                <p>We accept applications at any time of the year, for any future school year. Re-enrollment for our current families takes place in February, which determines how many spaces we will have available for new students for the following school year. In March we begin drawing students for admission from the applicant pool, balancing age and gender in our mixed age classrooms, and creating as diverse a community as possible. If you would like your child to be considered in this first round of applicants (recommended), an application should be received by our office by January 31 for Toddler, Early Childhood, and Extended Day  applicants.</p>
                <h6>When will we hear back from you?</h6>
                <p>Families who meet this deadline will be notified in early March about their acceptance. If your child is admitted you will be sent a tuition agreement along with your admission letter. You will then have seven days to secure your child&rsquo;s place by signing the contract and paying the Acceptance Fee (see Tuition).</p>
                <h6>What if I miss the January 31st deadline?</h6>
                <p>After the first round of admissions, there may be spaces still available for the upcoming school year. Applications are welcome and considered after the deadline for remaining spaces. We maintain a waiting pool year-round, in the event of an opening at any level later in the year.</p>
                <h6>What if another school has offered us admission and I haven&rsquo;t heard from MCHD yet?</h6>
                <p>Should you face an offer deadline from another school, please call us and inquire as to the status of your application.</p>
                <h6>What is the Financial Aid deadline?</h6>
                <p>If you would like to be considered for financial aid, please apply at the same time you apply to MCHD, so that, if possible, we can notify you of your award when we offer you a Tuition Agreement (this may not be possible for late applications over the summer). Applications and supporting documents will be due to TADS by mid-January for those families who wish to be considered in the first rounds of admissions. Application for assistance in no way affects the admission decision. All applications are kept confidential, and are identified only by a numerical code. Please see <a href="tuitionandaid_aid.html" target="_blank"><span class="sectionnav">Financial Aid</span></a> for more information.</p>
                <h6>What is considered a completed application?</h6>
                <p><em>For enrollment into Toddler or Early Childhood:</em></p>
                <ul>
                  <li>An observation in a classroom by at least one parent/guardian for an hour or more</li>
                  <li>A completed Application form submitted to the MCHD office</li>
                  <li>$100 application fee</li>
                </ul>
                <p><em>For enrollment into Extended Day (kindergarten) or Elementary grades:</em></p>
                <ul>
                  <li>An observation in a classroom by at least one parent/guardian for an hour or more</li>
                  <li>A completed Application form submitted to the MCHD office</li>
                  <li>$100 application fee</li>
                  <li>The child&rsquo;s student records and Teacher Assessment Form from current or former school(s)</li>
                  <li>An observation by a MCHD teacher in your child&rsquo;s current class or a meeting with your child, if possible. In some cases, we may ask the student to visit for a day in our classroom.</li>
                </ul>
                <h6>What is the difference between a waiting list and a waiting pool?</h6>
                <p>We don&rsquo;t keep a waiting list, we keep a waiting pool. In other words, there is no child &ldquo;next in line&rdquo; for enrollment. Because our classes are balanced by age and gender and diversity, the next child we admit is based on what will bring that class into balance. All applications received for that school year are kept in the waiting pool, and all applicants who could fill the open space are considered regardless of application date. We welcome applicants  to remain in the pool for the following year.</p>
                <h6>What if I&rsquo;m moving into the area and can&rsquo;t come to observe in a classroom?</h6>
                <p>We can conduct much of the admissions process by phone and by mail, and we&rsquo;d be happy to put you in touch with some current parents to speak to in lieu of visiting. Do let us know if you make a visit to the Triangle to interview or hunt for housing, and we&rsquo;d be glad to work with your schedule to find a time to visit the school.</p>
                <h6>Can I request which classroom my child will be in?</h6>
                <p>Parents are welcome to submit information about their child and his/her learning style, which will aid us in making class assignments. This information will join the several other criteria we use to balance the makeup of each class. Please ask the office for the Learning Styles Form to submit information about your child. </p>
                <h6>What happens if my circumstances change after I sign my Tuition Agreement?</h6>
                <p>Your Tuition Agreement is a contract between the school and the family. Parents are obligated to pay the full year&rsquo;s tuition and no reduction or credit will be granted if a student is withdrawn, unless the withdrawal is made at the specific request of the school. If you need to withdraw your child from the school after accepting a spot, however, you may enter the Replacement Program. Upon application and payment of the Replacement Fee, the school can attempt to enroll another child who will, in effect, take over your contract. Until that time, the original family is required to continue to make tuition payments on schedule. If a replacement is found, a balance due or refund is calculated on a prorated basis. For more information please ask to see the <a href="tuition.html#replacement"><span class="sectionnav">Replacement Policy</span></a> documents.</p>
                <h6>My son will turn 3 just after the August 31 cutoff. Can I still apply for Early Childhood?</h6>
                <p>Because Montessori education addresses the developmental stages of the children at each level, we  prefer to enroll children who will be three years old by September 1 of the year they start Preschool. Parents of younger children should consider the Pre-Three program as a more developmentally appropriate placement. If your child will turn three in September or before October 16, you may apply for Early Childhood, but we rarely admit children who are two to that level, and by state law your child would not be able to enter Extended Day until his fourth year in the Early Childhood class. If you wish to go ahead and apply for a younger student, your application will be considered for Early Childhood after August 1st, if there are still spaces unfilled at that time.</p>
                <p>The Toddler Program follows the Montessori curriculum for children from 18 months-36 months of age. Students in this program will enter Early Childhood the following fall if they have turned 3 by September 1.</p>
                <h6>What is the Diversity of your student body?</h6>
                <p>Diversity isn&rsquo;t just a buzzword here. We celebrate it. Our preschool is 40% racially diverse, and we embrace families with adopted children, or who practice one of the world&rsquo;s many religions, or who have two moms, or speak a different language at home.</p>
