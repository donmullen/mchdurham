            <p>Utilizing the principles of Maria Montessori, MCHD lays
            foundations for intellectual, moral, emotional, physical,
            social, and spiritual competence. We educate young people to
            have a sense of the grand order of the universe, to assume
            their rights and responsibilities, to find joy in learning,
            and to delight among the peoples and in the places where
            they live.</p>

            <p>At MCHD we strive to be Citizens of the World. Through
            critical analysis and self reflection we work to:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>Respect differences while recognizing our common humanity</li>
              <li>Transform bias and fear into knowledge and understanding</li>
              <li>Value all cultures as facets in the gem of humankind</li>

            <h3>Montessori at MCHD</h3>

            <p>Montessori Children’s House of Durham (MCHD) lays foundations
              for intellectual, moral, emotional, physical, social, and
              spiritual competence in our students. We shape young people who
              have a sense of the grand order of the universe, who can assume
              their rights and responsibilities, find joy in learning, and who
              delight among the peoples and in the places where they live.</p>
            <p>To accomplish these goals, MCHD implements the classical
              Montessori principles: the development of concentration, order,
              and coordination, which foster the discipline required for
              independence. These skills enable the child’s freedom of inquiry,
              while multi-age classrooms promote individualized
              education. Confidence and enthusiasm is gained from the ability to
              self-initiate and from success.</p>
            <p>These principles provide the framework for every level of our
              work -- the layout of the classroom, the design of the curriculum,
              the modeling of each activity, and the intention of each lesson
              with the individual child.</p>

            <p>The teachers each day guide children toward</p>

            <ul>
              <li>learning to make decisions in their practical lives,</li>
              <li>exploring a myriad of sensory experiences,</li>
              <li>savoring the power of words,</li>
              <li>reveling in the elegance of mathematics,</li>
              <li>cultivating their unique voice through the arts,</li>
              <li>discovering continents and cultures in geography,</li>
              <li>observing the marvelous wonders of the natural world,</li>
              <li>and linking the past to the present through historical studies</li>
            </ul>

            <p>In addition to our outstanding teaching staff, our
            programs are also set apart by a dedication to Montessori’s
            foundation in respect for the child. At MCHD, we respect the
            child’s innate desire to learn and inborn power to be
            competent.</p>

            <p>Moreover, teaching children to be responsible members of
            their community, and imparting the skills they need to
            problem-solve and resolve conflicts, is as important as
            academic instruction. Students learn to care for themselves,
            for others, and for their environment, and practice
            community responsibility and service as part of the
            curriculum. Each classroom becomes a community built on
            respect and trust.</p>

            <h3>MCHD History</h3>

            <p>The Montessori Children's House of Durham is a non-profit
            school founded in 1976 by a group of teachers and parents
            dedicated to the Montessori philosophy. MCHD's early history
            included classrooms in several Durham-area churches and the
            Walltown School. In 1989, MCHD moved to its present location
            at 2400 University Drive. This facility was re-designed and
            re-built through the efforts and perseverance of
            parents. Parents financed the project, did the planning,
            re-modeled the building, and made the vision a reality. In
            1991 a second building was erected on the site which houses
            the office and elementary classroom. The construction of
            this building -- from financing to completion -- was
            supervised and supported by the same group of parents. In
            1997, MCHD realized another long-term goal with the
            construction of a second elementary building and expansion
            to grade six. This project was made possible in great part
            by generous parent contributions to the Capital
            Campaign.</p>

            <p>In the Fall of 2001, MCHD was able to expand its programs
            by purchasing the house across the street. With minor
            changes, the house was prepared to open in 2002 as the
            Little House After School facility. In addition to providing
            extra-curricular enrichments and much-needed after school
            care, the added space provides a pleasant venue for
            meetings, social gatherings and special programs. Little
            House also hosts a Summer Camp each year.</p>

            <p>Summer 2012 brought MCHD to an exciting new chapter in
            our history, with the move to a brand-new campus on six
            acres on Pickett Rd. Architects worked with MCHD teachers to
            design the buildings and outdoor areas from the ground up
            with the Montessori pedagogy in mind.</p>

            <p>MCHD has been an affiliate of the American Montessori
            Society since 1977, and was the first school in North
            Carolina to receive accreditation from the American
            Montessori Society, in 1996. Our school undergoes a full
            re-accreditation process every seven years, and is required
            to submit annual reports to AMS to maintain our
            accreditation.<p>

        <section>
          <p class="title" data-section-title><a href="#what">What is Montessori?</a></p>
          <div class="content" data-slug="what" data-section-content>

            <h3>What is Montessori?</h3>
            <p>Montessori is a philosophy with the fundamental tenet
            that a child learns best within a social environment which
            supports each individual's unique development.</p>

            <h3>How Did it Begin?</h3>
            <img style="float:left" src="http://mchdurham.org/images/photo_montessori.jpg">
            <p>Dr. Maria Montessori, the creator of the Montessori
            Method of Education, based the techniques on her scientific
            observations of young children's behavior. As the first
            woman physician to graduate from the University of Rome,
            Montessori became involved with education as a doctor
            treating children labeled as retarded. Then in 1907 she was
            invited to open a child care center for the children of
            desperately poor families in the San Lorenzo slums of
            Rome.</p>

            <p>She called it a "Children's House," and based the program
            on her observations that young children learn best in a
            homelike setting, filled with developmentally appropriate
            materials that provide experiences contributing to the
            growth of self-motivated, independent learners.</p>

            <p>She carried her message throughout the world, including
            the United States as early as 1912. After an enthusiastic
            first response, interest in the US waned until a
            reintroduction of the method in the mid-1950's, followed by
            the organization of the American Montessori Society in
            1960.</p>

            <h3>What Makes Montessori Education Unique?</h3>
            <p>The "Whole Child" approach. The primary goal of a
            Montessori program is to help each child reach full
            potential in all areas of life. Activities promote the
            development of social skills, emotional growth, and physical
            coordination as well as cognitive preparation. The holistic
            curriculum, under the direction of a specially prepared
            teacher, allows the child to experience the joy of learning,
            time to enjoy the process and ensure the development of
            self-esteem, and provides the experiences from which
            children create their knowledge.</p>

            <p>The "Prepared Environment." In order for self-directed
            learning to take place, the whole learning environment
            (i.e., room, materials, and social climate) must be
            supportive of the learner. The teacher provides necessary
            resources, including opportunities for children to function
            in a safe and positive climate. The teacher thus gains the
            children's trust, which enables them to try new things and
            build self-confidence.</p>

            <p>The Montessori materials. Dr. Montessori's observations
            of the kinds of things which children enjoy and use
            repeatedly led her to design a number of multisensory,
            sequential and self-correcting materials which facilitate
            the learning of skills and lead to learning of abstract
            ideas.</p>

            <p>The Teacher. Originally called a Directress," the
            Montessori teacher functions as designer of the environment,
            resource person, role model, demonstrator, record-keeper,
            and meticulous observer of each child's behavior and
            growth.</p>

            <h3>How Does it Work?</h3>
            <p>Each Montessori class, from toddlers through high school,
            operates on the principle of freedom within limits. Every
            program has its set of ground rules which differs from age
            to age, but is always based on core Montessori beliefs -
            respect for each other and for the environment.</p>

            <p>Children are free to work at their own pace with
            materials they have chosen, either alone or with others. The
            teacher relies on her/his observations of the children to
            determine which new activities and materials she may
            introduce to an individual child or to a small or large
            group. The aim is to encourage active, self-directed
            learning and to strike a balance of individual mastery with
            small group collaboration within the whole group
            community.</p>

            <h3>How is Creativity Encouraged?</h3>
            <p>Creativity flourishes in an atmosphere of acceptance and
            trust. Montessorians recognize that each child, from toddler
            to teenager, learns and expresses her/himself in a very
            individual way.</p>

            <p>Music, art, storytelling, movement, and drama are part of
            every American Montessori program. But there are other
            things particular to the Montessori environment which
            encourage creative development: many materials which
            stimulate interest and involvement; an emphasis on the
            sensory aspect of experience; and the opportunity for both
            verbal and non-verbal modes of learning.</p>

            <h3>How Can a "Real" Montessori Classroom be Identified?</h3>
            <p>Since Montessori is a word in the public domain, it is
            possible for any individual or institution to claim to be
            Montessori. But, an authentic Montessori classroom must have
            these basic characteristics:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>Teachers educated and certified in the Montessori
              philosophy and methodology for the age level they are
              teaching, and who have the ability and dedication to put
              the concepts into practice.</li>
              <li>A partnership established with the family. The family
              is considered an integral part of the individual's total
              development.</li>
              <li>A multi-aged, heterogeneous grouping of students.</li>
              <li>A diverse set of Montessori materials, activities and
              experiences which are designed to foster physical,
              intellectual, creative and social independence.</li>
              <li>A schedule which allows large blocks of time to
              problem-solve, to see connections in knowledge and to
              create new ideas.</li>
              <li>A classroom atmosphere which encourages social
              interaction for cooperative learning, peer teaching, and
              emotional development.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>What Happens When a Child Leaves Montessori?</h3>
            <p>Montessori children are unusually adaptable. They have
            learned to work independently and in groups. Since they've
            been encouraged to make decisions from an early age, these
            children are problem-solvers who can make choices and manage
            their time well.</p>

            <p>They have also been encouraged to exchange ideas and to
            discuss their work freely with others. Good communication
            skills ease the way in new settings.</p>

            <p>Research has shown that the best predictor of future
            success is a sense of self-esteem. Montessori programs,
            based on self-directed, non-competitive activities, help
            children develop a good self-image and the confidence to
            face challenges and changes with optimism.</p>

            <p>MCHD is proud to have been an affiliate of the American
            Montessori Society since our inception in 1976.</p>

            <h4>Accreditation</h4>
            <p>Montessori Children’s House of Durham first became
            recognized as an Accredited School by
            the <a href="http://www.amshq.org/">American Montessori
            Society</a> (AMS) in 1996, the first school in North
            Carolina to achieve this status. Today, we remain one of
            only four AMS Accredited Montessori schools in North
            Carolina.</p>

            <h5>What does being Accredited mean?</h5>
            <p>It means that MCHD has met the highest level of standards set by AMS for:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>Providing appropriate, quality educational programs,
              and assessing outcomes to meet educational goals</li>
              <li>Maintaining a qualified, certified lead teacher in every classroom</li>

          <div class="content" data-slug="faqs" data-section-content>
            <h4>Frequently Asked Questions about MCHD and Montessori</h4>

            <h5>How far up (in grades) do you go?</h5>
            <p>MCHD enrolls children from 18 months through the sixth grade. Children must be 18 months for Toddler, or 3 for Early Childhood, by September 1. In 2009, North Carolina state law will require all children to be 5 by Sept. 1 to enter kindergarten. Elementary students are grouped into classrooms of first through third grades, and fourth through sixth grades, in keeping with the Montessori practice of mixed age classrooms.</p>

            <h5>How do the children get lessons?</h5>
            <p>In Early Childhood, the group is given lessons every day (and again in Extended Day at the start of the afternoon session). The children may also ask for a lesson with the work they have chosen, or the teacher will say to a child, “Come, I have a lesson for you,” or will observe that a child would benefit from having a lesson re-presented. In the Elementary grades, each child has a weekly work plan, based on the lessons to be given that week, and is expected to complete the assigned work during that period.</p>

            <h5>What does the curriculum consist of for each level?</h5>
            <p>See Academic Programs, where a detailed curriculum guide is posted for each level.</p>

            <h5>What’s the best way to see how Montessori education works?</h5>
            <p>Parents should call the office at 489-9045 to schedule an observation in one of our classrooms – this is the best way to see what MCHD is like. In fact, it’s so important, it’s a required part of our application process.</p>

            <h5>Why do you have mixed age classrooms?</h5>
            <p>The mixed age class (children stay in each class for three years at a time -- 2 in Toddler) allows children to be able to progress according to their unique developmental schedule. Each child enters “sensitive periods” at very individual times. The prepared environment of the classroom is ready for that child’s sudden eagerness to absorb the concept of number, or the desire to master pre-reading skills, for instance, whenever it occurs. Furthermore, older children learn by teaching the younger ones, and younger children are able to see what lies ahead (in what the older children are doing), which creates the desire in them to go on to the next set of skills. Finally, the mixed age class allows children to make progress in intellectual development separately from their social and emotional readiness.</p>

            <h5>Is the Montessori ‘curriculum’ very structured?</h5>
            <p>Yes, but there is freedom within order. Young children thrive on order and regularity, seeking it out in their environment, but also need to express themselves individually and creatively. Our classrooms offer lots of both.</p>

            <h5>Do children get to ‘play’?</h5>
            <p>Yes, Montessori believed that children’s play is the work they do to develop and grow into competent adults. Experienced teachers understand that there is a great deal or learning and practicing packed into what looks, to the casual observer, like ordinary play. Current research confirms that the games of our youth built and developed skills in all areas of development. Montessori termed what they do in the classrooms “work,” because children are driven to master new skills, and this play is as essential and vital to them as satisfying work is to adults.</p>

            <h5>What is a preschool child’s day like?</h5>
            <p>In the Early Childhood class, the children have one or two group times at some point during the morning, at which time there is singing, conversation, and a lesson usually given to the whole group, introducing some new work into the classroom, or opening a new continent map, or conducting a science experiment, for instance. The children will have individual or group snack during the morning, and each class has at least half an hour on the playground every day. The bulk of the morning is given to the work period, during which children will choose and engage in work. The teachers will be giving individual or small group lessons during this time.</p>

            <h5>Do children do any art?</h5>
            <p>Yes, art is part of the offerings available in every classroom every day. Beginning in Extended Day, students get formal instruction in a curriculum that extends through sixth grade, in the five elements of art (line, shape, color form, perspective), art history, and in the use of many media.</p>

            <p>Music is also part of every day, through singing, and music theory and recorder lessons in Elementary; and Composer of the Month in Upper El.</p>

            <h5>Can children attend fewer than five days a week?</h5>
            <p>No, we find the regularity of five days a week is beneficial to the child’s security, knowing what to expect every morning (it’s a school day, it’s a home day). This follows the traditional Montessori curriculum.</p>

            <h5>What are the hours?</h5>
            <p>Toddler: 8:30-11:45; no after-school available</p>
            <p>Early Childhood (3 and 4): 8:30-12:00; after-school until 2:45 or 4:00</p>
            <p>Extended Day (age 5): 8:30-2:30; after-school until 4:00 or 5:30</p>
            <p>Elementary (grades 1-6): 8:20-3:00; after-school until 4:00 or 5:30</p>

            <h5>What do parents do when school is out?</h5>
            <p>School Plus! offers No School Camp on Teacher Workdays, Parent-Teacher Conference days, and Winter and Spring Break. School Plus! also offers summer camp on a weekly basis for most of the summer. These programs are not available for Toddler students.</p>

            <h5>How many students are enrolled at MCHD?</h5>
            <p>128 this year, Toddler through 6th grade.</p>

            <h5>What is the Diversity of your student body?</h5>
            <p>Diversity isn’t just a buzzword here. We celebrate it. Our preschool is 40% racially diverse, and we embrace families with adopted children, or who practice one of the world’s many religions, or who have two moms, or speak a different language at home.</p>

            <h5>What is the student-teacher ratio?</h5>
            <p>Toddler: 1:6 (class of 12 with 2 adults)</p>
            <p>Early Childhood : 1:11 (class of 22 with 2 adults)</p>
            <p>Elementary: 1:9 or 10 (class of 18-20 with 2 adults)</p>
            <p>These ratios are successful because 1) the children are taught to be so independent, and they need little help from adults for much of their work; 2) the older ones serve as models and helpers to the younger ones, and 3) the children stay in each class for three years in a row (except Toddler), so they know the procedures and teachers well. The best way to see how well it works is through a classroom observation!</p>

            <h5>How do teachers and parents communicate?</h5>
            <p>Our teachers are very available to answers quick questions on the playground, by phone, or by email. A more in-depth discussion can be scheduled at a mutually convenient time. Formal parent-teacher conferences are scheduled twice annually in November and March.</p>

            <h5>Are your teachers certified?</h5>
            <p>Yes, the lead teachers are trained and certified in an American Montessori Society-approved program. All of our assistant teachers and After School Instructors have at least a bachelor’s degree, and are trained in-house. Are they State licensed? No, they are not required to be.</p>

            <h5>How often do your teachers and assistants turn over?</h5>
            <p>We enjoy very low teacher turnover. Most of our lead teachers have been here a decade -- or three! – and even our assistant teachers typically stay for several years, some of them leaving to go on to get their own Montessori teacher certification.</p>

            <h5>Where do your students go after they leave MCHD?</h5>
            <p>Typically, about 50% go on to public schools, and 50% go on to other private schools. Recently, many of our graduates have gone to one of the two Montessori middle schools in Durham County.</p>

            <h5>How do MCHD students do in a traditional setting when they leave here?</h5>
            <p>Our students do very well in all settings, as they are well-prepared academically, and are self-directed, engaged learners, have lots of social skills, and are independent, capable people.</p>

              <h4>MCHD Parents Association</h4>
              <p><img src="http://mchdurham.org/images/photo_sq_10.jpg" width="214" height="208" align="left" />We are fortunate to have a diverse community that contributes to the richness of our children&rsquo;s Montessori experience. The time, talent, diversity, and energy of families enhance our children&rsquo;s education at MCHD. All parents or guardians of students currently enrolled at MCHD are automatically considered members of the MCHD Parents&rsquo; Association. There are no dues or fees associated with membership.</p>
              <p>The overall mission of the Parents Association (PA) is to support the MCHD community in a variety of ways, in keeping with the Montessori philosophy. The PA&rsquo;s primary purpose is to build and support a sense of community within MCHD. We accomplish this by encouraging parental involvement in community activities, by providing social and educational opportunities for all members of the community, by supporting the teachers and staff in their daily work, and by fostering communication among all members of the MCHD family.</p>
                <p>The PA is led by a Steering Committee, a group of half a dozen or so parents, teachers, and administrators. The Steering Committee solicits input from anyone within the MCHD Community, and maintains a seat on the Board of Directors. Steering Committee meetings are open to every parent or guardian. </p>
                <p>Parents Association activities can be grouped into two categories: community-building, and teacher and staff support. The PA partially offsets the costs of these activities by fund-raising through sales of school T-shirts, yearbooks, tote bags or other items, and through the School Rewards programs sponsored by various local stores. Remaining costs are covered by an allocation of operating funds from the Board of Directors every year.</p>
                <p>Programs and activities sponsored by the PA each year include: Class Parents, Fall Picnic, Parent Breakfasts (during sign-up for Conferences), <em>Tomorrow&rsquo;s Child</em> Montessori Magazine, Spring Picnic, Spring Fling, Staff Appreciation Week, Staff Breakfasts, School Pictures, Yearbook, and a Box Lunch for Staff during Conferences. </p>
