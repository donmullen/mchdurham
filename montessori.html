      <h3>Montessori at MCHD</h3>
      <p>Montessori Children’s House of Durham (MCHD) lays foundations
      for intellectual, moral, emotional, physical, social, and
      spiritual competence in our students. We shape young people who
      have a sense of the grand order of the universe, who can assume
      their rights and responsibilities, find joy in learning, and who
      delight among the peoples and in the places where they live.</p>
      <p>To accomplish these goals, MCHD implements the classical
      Montessori principles: the development of concentration, order,
      and coordination, which foster the discipline required for
      independence. These skills enable the child’s freedom of inquiry,
      while multi-age classrooms promote individualized
      education. Confidence and enthusiasm is gained from the ability to
      self-initiate and from success.</p>
      <p>These principles provide the framework for every level of our
      work -- the layout of the classroom, the design of the curriculum,
      the modeling of each activity, and the intention of each lesson
      with the individual child.</p>
