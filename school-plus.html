            <h4>After School</h4>

            <h5>After School Care</h5>

            <p>MCHD is pleased to offer quality after school care to our
            families for children ages 3-12. In this home-like,
            electronics-free environment, students enjoy indoor and
            outdoor play time, and an opportunity to practice the social
            aspects of their Montessori education in after-school
            time.</p>

            <p>The program includes time for lunch and snack, play,
            quiet rest, and creative activities in different rooms. We
            have space for special classes, as well as a quiet place for
            older students to read and engage in extended projects. With
            a full kitchen and beautiful, dedicated playground, going to
            School Plus! is almost like going home after school.</p>

            <p>There are a variety of after-school days and pick-up
            times to choose from in order to fit your familyâ€™s schedule
            (see <a href="#after-care">After School Care</a>). Drop-In
            Care is available for occasional needs as space
            permits. School Plus! also
            offers <a href="#no-school-camp">No-School Camp</a> on
            Teacher Workdays, Parent-Teacher conference days,
            Orientation Week, and Winter and Spring break.</p>

            <p>Students preschool age and older are eligible to attend
            childcare until 6:00pm.</p>

            <p><emphasis>Please note there is no after school care
            available for children enrolled in the Toddler
            Program.</emphasis></p>

            <h5>Before School Care</h5>

            <p>Children ages 18 months through 12 can enroll in before
            school care, offering supervision on the Early Childhood
            playground as early as 7:45 am (8:20 a.m. for Toddlers). The
            cost of before school care enrollment is $550/year, payable
            over 10 months. Occasional drop-in care is available as
            space permits.</p>

            <h5>Enrichment Programs</h5>

            <p>School Plus! offers a range of after-school <a href="#enrichments">Enrichment
                Programs</a> in piano, ukulele, movement, dramatic arts,
            craft-making, and other classes, through contracts with
            local professional teachers. Each class has a separate
            enrichment fee which is in addition to MCHD tuition and
            After School fees. These are offered to all MCHD students,
            and special package rates for drop-in care are available for
              enrichment students not enrolled in the <a href="#after-care">after school</a>
            program.</p>

            <h4>Summer Camp</h4>
            <h5>June 10 - August 16, 2013</h5>
            <emphasis>Monday-Friday 8:00 - 3:00    OR</emphasis>

            <hb/>
            <emphasis>Extended Hours option until 6:00</emphasis>

            <p>Full-day, weekly summer camps are available for children
            ages 3-6. Camp runs daily from 9:00 am to 12:00 pm or 8:00am
            to 3:00pm, with an additional extended hours option until
            6:00 pm. Children engage in a variety of indoor and outdoor
            activities each day. Each weekly session revolves around a
            particular theme such as gardening, science, and creative or
            dramatic arts. All sessions incorporate music, literature,
            and creative movement throughout the week, with plenty of
            time for good old-fashioned, summertime fun. With a low
            student-to-teacher ratio, our experienced staff facilitates
            independence, social graces, and creative expression in the
            children.</p>

              <p><img src="http://mchdurham.org/images/photo_hz_02.jpg" width="264" height="168" align="left">School Plus! offers a range of optional after-school Enrichment Programs in piano, violin, dramatic arts, movement or dance, yoga, craft-making, and more, through contracts with local professional teachers. Some offerings are individual lessons (e.g. piano); some are group classes targeted for a particular age range of students. Offerings vary from semester to semester, although there are some constants (piano). Sign-up is on a semester by semester basis.</p>
              <p>Each class has a separate Enrichment Fee which is in addition to MCHD tuition and After School fees. Special package rates for drop-in care are available for enrichment students not enrolled in the After School program, so that a child can attend After School between the end of the school day and the time the enrichment class begins.</p>

              <h3>New Student Orientation at School Plus!</h3>
              <p>In the tradition of Montessori education, we believe in preparation of the child for new experiences and tasks. For those new children enrolled in after-school care, we invite them to a separate orientation at <a href="school-plus.html#about">School Plus!</a>, but wait until the end of their first week of orientation at school, so as not to introduce too many new things at once. (see <a href="admissions.html#orientation.html">New Student Orientation</a>)</p>
              <p>On the Friday of that week (Orientation Week One), School Plus! briefly opens its doors to all newly enrolled SP! Preschool children and their parents, from 10:15am &ndash; 11:00am (directly after class at MCHD). We invite parents to meet their children and the SP! Instructors on the Preschool playground so that the child may experience the first trip from MCHD to SP! after school with a parent in hand. Upon arrival at School Plus!, parent and child will be able to tour the rooms, and get acquainted with the daily routine and their child&rsquo;s instructors. During this time, the SP! Director and Instructors will be available for questions. </p>
              <p>New students who are not enrolled in after-school care throughout the year may want to utilize other SP! services such as No School Camp, Drop In Care, and/or Enrichments. If you would like to schedule a parent/child tour prior to attendance in any After School program, please call the After School office at 489-9045.</p>
              <h4>No School Camp during Orientation Week Two</h4>
              <p>During Orientation Week One, School Plus! is closed to make the transition between summer camp and the regular school year. School Plus! offers new and returning students a variety of optional schedules for Orientation Week Two that supports the MCHD Orientation schedule. See <a href="http://mchdurham.org/calendars/2013-14&#32;Orientation&#32;Only&#32;Calendar.pdf">Orientation Schedule </a>for more specific details.</p>

Children enjoy free play until they are dismissed to go to their classroom. On rainy or very cold days, students will play inside in one of the classrooms.</p>
            <p>For those families not enrolled as daily participants in Before School Care, drop-in care is available for the occassional day when you need to arrive before the normal starting time, as space permits. No advance notice is required. </p>
            <p>The cost of Before School Care enrollment is $520/year, payable over 10 months. Fee for occassional drop-in care: $3.00/day.</p>

              <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
              <h5>How do I sign up for After School Care?</h5>
              <p>By signing a Tuition Agreement for <a href="school-plus.html#after-care"> After School</a> (AS). This is in addition to your Tuition Agreement for MCHD.</p>
              <h5>Is my child guaranteed a space in the After School Care program when I return my Tuition Agreement for MCHD?</h5>
              <p>Yes, as long as you return a signed contract for <a href="school-plus.html#after-care">After School Care</a> by the deadline, April 1st.</p>
              <h5>What if I won&rsquo;t know until after April 1 that I will need care for after school?</h5>
              <p>Contracts submitted after April 1st will still be accepted, subject to available space. We will let you know by July 1st if we <em>cannot</em> honor your contract if turned in after April 1st. The Director of the After School program can let you know whether spaces remain in the program.</p>
              <h5>Can I sign up for less than five days a week?<h5>
              <p>After School offers two options for after-school care: Full-time (MTWTHF), or Part-time (MWF <em>or</em> TTH). All AS contracts, part-time or full-time, received by 3:30pm, April 1st, will be honored. After that date, while we will prioritize with full-time contracts to fill remaining spaces, we will make an effort to honor part-time contracts by matching them with the appropriate alternate part-time contract (a MWF will be matched with a TTH contract).</p>
              <h5>Can my newly enrolled child and I visit After School for an orientation?</h5>
              <p>Yes. On Friday of Orientation Week One (see <a href="http://mchdurham.org/Calendars/2011_12_Calendar.pdf">School Calendar</a>, or <a href="admissions.html#orientation">New Student Orientation</a>), After School conducts its own orientation for all newly enrolled After School Preschool children and parents from 10:15am &ndash; 11:00am (directly after class time at MCHD). We invite parents to meet their children and the After School Instructors on the Preschool playground so that the child may experience the first trip from MCHD to After School with a parent in hand. Upon arrival at After School, parent and child will be able to tour the rooms, and get acquainted with the daily routine and their child&rsquo;s instructors.</p>
              <p>For new students who are <em>not</em> enrolled in regular after-school care throughout the year, but who may want to utilize other School Plus! services such as <a href="school-plus.html#no-school-camp">No School Camps</a>, <a href="school-plus.html#drop-in-care">Drop In Care</a>, and/or <a href="school-plus.html#enrichments">Enrichments</a>, we will schedule one or two visitation days for a parent/child tour early in the fall, so your child will feel comfortable as an occasional visitor to After School.</p>
              <h5>What is Drop In Care?</h5>
              <p>Any MCHD student may use Drop In Care, <em>space permitting</em>, if they only need care at After School from time to time. Drop In Care must be scheduled at least 15 minutes or more in advance. Special package rates for Drop In Care are available for Enrichment students not enrolled in the After School program. This option provides an escort from MCHD to After School at the end of the school day and care before and/or after the Enrichment class.</p>
              <h5>Can my child come to After School on Teacher Workdays, even if we aren&rsquo;t enrolled in After School Care?</h5>
              <p>Yes. After School offers <a href="school-plus.html#no-school-camp">No School Camp</a> on Teacher Workdays, Parent-Teacher Conference days, Orientation Week Two, and Winter and Spring Breaks for all MCHD children ages 3 to 12. These camp days are bustling with group and individual activities, indoor and outdoor play, and lunch and snack time.</p>
              <p>Parents can sign up for No School Camp one day at a time, or for the whole semester. There are several schedule options for these camp days. Camps are staffed by regular After School instructors.</p>
              <h5>Does After School offer No School Camp during Orientation Weeks?</h5>
              <p>After School will be closed Orientation Week One to transition between summer camp and the regular school year.&nbsp; During Orientation Week Two, if your child is three or four years old, they may come to  No School Camp <em>only if </em>they are enrolled for regular After School Care for the academic year. We recommend that these new Preschool students attend Camp this week if possible to familiarize themselves with the environment, schedules, and their AS instructors.</p>
              <p>All new <a href="academics.html#extday">Extended Day</a> and/or Elementary students and all returning students may come to AS during Orientation Week Two, even if you have <em>not</em> signed an after-school contract.</p>
