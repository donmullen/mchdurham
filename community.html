            <p>Our community is a mosaic of unique experiences, diverse
            lifestyles, and varied understandings of the broader
            world.</p>
            <p>MCHD celebrates and nurtures individual differences and
            affirms sameness through a culture of inclusion, care, and
            respect.</p>
            <p>Our perspective is constantly enriched and renewed by the
            involvement of families whose active presence, stories, and
            commitment help us all grow.</p>
            <p>We are all united in our passion for peace as Citizens of the World.</p>

            <p>Diversity at MCHD is not a number but a dynamic
            experience of rich interactions among our students, faculty,
            staff, and families in the classroom, on the playground, and
            at organized school events.  This page offers a current
            snapshot of the unique atmosphere within which our students
            learn about each other, their community, and the world.</p>
