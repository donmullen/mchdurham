              inclusion, care, and respect.<br />
              <br />
              Our perspective is<br />
              <strong>constantly enriched and renewed</strong><br />
              by the involvement of families <br />
              whose active presence, stories, and<br />
              commitment<br />
              help us all grow.<br />

            <p>Diversity at MCHD is not a number but a dynamic
            experience of rich interactions among our students, faculty,
            staff, and families in the classroom, on the playground, and
            at organized school events.  This page offers a current
            snapshot of the unique atmosphere within which our students
            learn about each other, their community, and the world.</p>

            <p>The MCHD classroom is an intimate setting where diversity
            is not only encountered but explored through:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>group lessons,</li>
              <li>individual work plans,</li>
              <li>classrom events,</li>
              <li>and parent sharings.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Because our teachers have a longer tenure at MCHD than is
            typical for schools, our community is able to benefit
            from</p>
            <ul>
              <li>the diverse backgrounds of our teachers</li>
              <li>the maturation of keen observance skills inherent to the Montessori Philosophy</li>
              <li>a continuity in school priorities year to year such as
              our Diversity recruitment and retention efforts.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Currently, in an effort to foster cultural competency,
            our faculty and staff are participating in the Teaching
            Diverse Students Initiative, a project of the Southern
            Poverty Law Center.</p>

            <p>MCHD enrichment extends beyond the classroom into
            organized school events which seek to foster a sincere bond
            between families.</p>

            <p>We devote the same unparalleled intensity in cultivating
            an atmosphere of inclusion, care and respect for our
            families as we do for our students.</p>

            <p>Some refer to this experience as school spirit; others, a
            welcoming culture. The best explanation, however, is that we
            have true community at MCHD that thrives on the diversity
            within.</p>
