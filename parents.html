            <h3>The Family-School Partnership</h3>
            <p><a href="http://www.amshq.org/">The American Montessori Society</a> (AMS) is committed to
            promoting effective family-school partnerships through
            following principles of good practice for member
            schools. Both the American Montessori Society, and the
            families it serves, recognize that effective partnerships
            are characterized by mutual respect, open communication, a
            shared commitment to collaboration, clearly defined
            responsibilities, and a common vision of goals for the
            child.</p>

            <h3>Participation</h3>
            <p>MCHD is most successful when parents make a commitment,
            at whatever level they can, to participate in the school
            experience.  Commitment can vary greatly from parent to
            parent: for some it may mean being a class parent to
            coordinate support for the teachers regularly, to others it
            may mean service on the Board of Directors or participation
            in Parentsâ€™ Association projects, and to others it may mean
            helping to move a mountain of mulch on grounds workdays or
            making a financial contribution. We encourage everyone to
            learn about the many opportunities for participation
            available, and to choose those that fit best with your
            personal interests and your available time and
            resources.</p>
