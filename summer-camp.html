            <h4>Weekly Themes and Schedule</h4>
            <p> STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts/Design, and Math) camp themes include activities, challenges, art, design, and transitions. The camps also promote literacy and language development through theme-aligned discussions, presentations to an audience, spatial language concept review, reflections, and stories. Each theme includes take-home activity suggestions so at-home adults may extend the fun and theme into time at home. Themed activities are only one part of the MCHD camp experience; campers also have plenty of time to play (outdoors and indoors), and engage in water play, movement, music, art, and story time. At MCHD summer camp, we tend gardens, share and explore nature, sing, dance, and make friends! </p>
            <p><span class="style1 style3 style5"><strong>2013 Summer Camp Themes </strong></span></p>
            <h6>June 10 &ndash; 14: Creature Features (Closed)</h6>
            <p>Campers build their own (real or make-believe) animals and work with them throughout the week. They&rsquo;ll explore animal movements and skills, tracks and sounds, camouflage and covering, food and habitats, and adult animal &ldquo;parenting&rdquo; skills. Spatial/language concepts include &ldquo;up&rdquo; and &ldquo;down.&rdquo; Campers will work with an adult to draw, write and make a class book about all their animals. Campers will perform for the class as their animal, focusing on showing how their animals communicate. We&rsquo;ll also go on animal walks, and students will share their animal with their grown-up (from home or from school) during a Class Zoo presentation at the end of the week. </p>
            <h6>June 17-21: How We Get Around (Closed)</h6>
            <p> This camp helps campers expand their knowledge of vehicles and where vehicles travel in their neighborhood. Campers will design and construct a pretend vehicle using ordinary objects and create a map and a prototype of a neighborhood, complete with sidewalks, roads, rivers, and routes their vehicle can travel. Spatial/language concepts include &ldquo;beside&rdquo; and &ldquo;between.&rdquo; They&rsquo;ll learn about vehicle safety and universal road signs, and add those to their neighborhood too! As a culminating activity, campers will tour their (home or school) adults through their neighborhood and treat them to a &ldquo;snack on the go&rdquo; the students have made. </p>
            <h6>June 24-28: Crawling and Slithering(Closed)</h6>
            <p> Crawling and Slithering campers delve into how insects and reptiles move and the habitats in which they live. Campers will build their own crawly and slithery creatures and their environments from ordinary objects. They&rsquo;ll also create images and descriptions of their creatures and combine them in a camp book. Spatial/language concepts include &ldquo;inside&rdquo; and &ldquo;outside.&rdquo; Campers will learn to spot woodland creatures that live no higher than one foot above the ground, and we&rsquo;ll share crawling, slithering micro-hikes and caterpillar walks. We&rsquo;ll learn about the important roles crawling and slithering creatures play in the pyramid of life, plant decomposition, and how they are essential to the human food supply. </p>
            <h6>July 1-5: No camp</h6>
            <h6>July 8-12: The Places We Can Go (Waitlist only)</h6>
            <p> During this week, campers will learn about many different world environments. They&rsquo;ll explore characteristics of different geographical locations and learn to make maps. They&rsquo;ll design objects to place in each type of environment and curate an art gallery of these objects to share with their adult at the end of the week. They&rsquo;ll create foods representative of a variety of environments and interview their home adults about places they&rsquo;ve lived or visited. Spatial/language concepts include &ldquo;together,&rdquo; &ldquo;apart,&rdquo; and &ldquo;island.&rdquo; After envisioning a journey, campers will decide how they should travel and gather what they should bring with them. Finally, they&rsquo;ll create a make-believe destination and design a game the people who live there might play. </p>
            <h6>July 15-19: Up-cycling and Recycling (Waitlist only)</h6>
            <p> Campers will learn about the concepts of environment, reducing, reusing, recycling, composting, and up-cycling. They&rsquo;ll learn about changes and patterns in their environment. Children will brainstorm how to reuse items that are often considered trash, learn what really happens to trash we generate, and how we can reduce the amount of trash generated. Spatial/language concepts include &ldquo;empty&rdquo; and &ldquo;full.&rdquo; Children will make a paper recycling center to take home and learn how they can improve the environment around them. </p>
            <h6>July 22-26: Space Explorer (Waitlist only)</h6>
            <p> In this camp, children let their imaginations soar! What if someday they really build a rocket ship or go to another planet? Campers will design and construct a pretend space ship from ordinary materials, imagine traveling to and walking on the Earth&rsquo;s moon, and design their own moons. They&rsquo;ll plan what they need to take with them to the moon, make a nutritious snack for the trip, and act out their journey. Spatial/language concepts include &ldquo;around&rdquo; and &ldquo;through.&rdquo; Children will illustrate a book of their travel story and then explain the pictures to the group. </p>
            <h6>July 29-August 2: Ocean Creatures</h6>
            <p> Ocean Creatures expands campers&rsquo; knowledge of living ocean creatures and their ocean and land habitats. They&rsquo;ll learn about more unusual ocean life forms, such as seaweed, jellyfish and coral, and learn how ocean animals and humans breathe in different ways. They&rsquo;ll imagine and create their own creature and ocean and decide how their creatures sound and communicate. They&rsquo;ll act out how their creature moves. Spatial/language concepts include &ldquo;on top of&rdquo; and &ldquo;beneath.&rdquo; Campers will learn to compare the ocean habitat with their neighborhood. </p>
            <h6>August 5-9: Onomatopoeia Dinosaurs (Only a few spaces remaining)</h6>
            <p> Many children are fascinated by dinosaurs, but no one really knows how they sounded. Campers will construct from found objects pretend dinosaurs, dinosaur footprints, and dinosaur habitats. They&rsquo;ll name their dinosaur species, learn about onomatopoeia and make up their own to represent the sounds they think their dinosaurs will make. Spatial/language concepts include &ldquo;small&rdquo; and &ldquo;large&rdquo; and onomatopoeia. Campers will problem solve how to find and return a lost dinosaur to its habitat. Finally, they&rsquo;ll create original dinosaur &ldquo;plays&rdquo; with their dinosaurs. </p>
            <h6>August 12-16: Water, Water Everywhere</h6>
            <p> Campers will learn about the attributes of water and the characteristics of fish. They&rsquo;ll design fish and conduct experiments with water to learn how water can transition between gas, liquid and solid. They&rsquo;ll learn about &ldquo;sink&rdquo; and &ldquo;float&rdquo; and the spatial concepts of &ldquo;above and below.&rdquo; Campers will learn how different kinds of water habitats can provide homes to different kinds of animals, and they&rsquo;ll compare the sizes of different animals that live in the water. Finally, they&rsquo;ll &ldquo;invent&rdquo; a water-based snack and author and perform a skit to inform their audience about the new snack. </p>

            <h4>Frequently Asked Questions</h4>
            <h5>What are your drop-off and pick-up procedures?</h5>
            <p>Bring your child in to School Plus! in the morning and check in with a staff member. We offer group dismissal at 3 pm; students scheduled to leave at 3 will gather in the dismissal shelter and be escorted to their cars by Summer Camp Staff. Parents of students leaving at times other than 3 pm should come intothe building to sign out their child/ren. At pick-up time your child may be out on the playground, but make sure you&rsquo;ve checked inside for items or notes to go home, and that you've signed out your child on the roster as you leave.</p>
            <h5>Where can we park?</h5>
            <p>Parents may prefer to park in the South Parking Lot (nearest to entrance), but if the lot is full, parents may park in the North Parking Lot and walk up to School Plus!</p>
            <h5>What if my child becomes sick at Summer Camp?</h5>
            <p>If staff determines that your child is too sick to continue to participate in activities, you will be notified immediately, and you will be responsible for picking up your child within a reasonable period of time.</p>
            <h5>When can my child come back to Summer Camp after being ill?</h5>
            <p>Before returning to Summer Camp, your child must be naturally free of fever, vomiting, or diarrhea for 24 hours. Your child must also remain at home until 24 hours have elapsed since the first dose of prescribed medication, and/or until the results of a throat culture are known.</p>
            <h5>What if my child needs medication during the day?</h5>
            <p>If your child needs <em>any</em> form of medication during the day, including cough drops, 'natural' and/or prescribed medication, you will need to fill out the Permission to Administer Medication form in the summer camp office, and leave the medication and form with a staff member. <strong>Absolutely no medications should be put in your child&rsquo;s lunch box.</strong> Please provide only those doses that are needed during the day, and keep evening doses at home. </p>
            <h5>What happens if my child is involved in an accident?</h5>
            <p>Minor accidents receive the prompt and careful attention of staff members who are trained in First Aid and CPR. In the event of a serious accident, parents (or your Emergency contacts) are notified at once. In cases of emergency, a staff member will call 911 to dispatch an ambulance, and parents (or your Emergency contacts) will be notified immediately. </p>
            <h5>How do you handle discipline?</h5>
            <p>If inappropriate behavior or a conflict occurs, children are taught to be respectful towards themselves, toward others, and with their environment. An instructor will guide the child(ren) through the conflict resolution process using calm, neutral, and factual language, and may offer quiet time as necessary. If conflicts recur, parents are notified and consulted in working together toward a positive resolution.</p>
            <h5>How do you handle hitting or biting?</h5>
            <p>If a child physically endangers him/herself or others, he/she is removed from the situation and may shadow the instructor, or be given quiet time away from the group. Parents will be notified of the situation so that we may work together towards a positive resolution.</p>
            <p>MCHD reserves the right to ask a camper not to return due to behavioral problems, and camp fees are forfeited.</p>
            <h5>What is a Dismissal Authorization?</h5>
            <p>The Dismissal Authorization section, found on your child&rsquo;s Emergency Information Form, is a list of friends, relatives, and/or caregivers who have your permission to pick up your child on a standing basis. We will not release your child to anyone for whom we do not have your written authorization, so please keep this information current with the office.</p>
            <h5>What if my child is going home with someone just for the day?</h5>
            <p>If your child will be going home with someone not listed on your dismissal list (a friend from camp, perhaps) please provide your child&rsquo;s teacher with a dated, signed note that morning, specifying who will pick up your child.</p>
