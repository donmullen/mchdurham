          <div class="content" data-slug="facultystaff" data-section-content>
              <p>The strength of our programs is founded not only on the soundness of the Montessori method, but also the dedication and experience of our faculty. All lead teachers are Montessori-certified in a program accredited by the American Montessori Society or one of its affiliates (some are certified for multiple levels). Certification prepares the teacher for the developmental stages and characteristics of the age range of children they teach, as well as the curriculum in all of its facets, academic and social. Most of our teachers have more than a decade of experience in MCHD&rsquo;s classrooms, and some considerably more than that. Turnover among teachers and assistant teachers at MCHD is very low from year to year. Teachers are required to hold a Bachelor&rsquo;s degree or higher, and most assistant teachers and other instructional staff are college-educated as well. The teaching staff bring their individual talents and interests into the classroom, heightening their students&rsquo; enthuisam for science, music, drama, foreign language, or cultural studies.<p>
              <p>The faculty is supported by a responsive administration and Board of Directors, and an enthusiastic and involved group of parents. The mission of the <a href="montessori.html#pa">Parents Association</a> is to support the faculty and the school, and build community within and among parents and staff.</p>
              <p>Part-time staff &ndash; for lunch, the Early Morning program, and substitute teachers &ndash; are often current parents employed by the school for these positions. They are trained in-house by MCHD to make every child&rsquo;s day be consistent in the Montessori philosophy of grace, courtesy, care, and respect wherever they go. We know that a great deal of social development happens out on the playground, so we work to ensure that our conflict resolution procedures are the same there as they are in the classroom.</p>
              <p>Above all, the strength of our teachers lies in their responsiveness to the needs of their students, as a group and as individuals, and in their ability to guide children toward responsibility, independence, competence, and pleasure in their endeavors.</p>

            <p>Kathleen Batson was hired in the spring of 2007 to inaugurate the MCHD Toddler program. Prior to the birth of her son, Atticus, in 2004, Kathleen was the assistant teacher in the Toddler room at Montessori Community School for four years.&nbsp; She also ran a toddler program for a small Montessori school in Minneapolis MN, and has several years experience teaching in non-Montessori preschool environments.&nbsp; Kathleen has also taught environmental education courses at Prospect Park Environmental Center in Brooklyn, NY and has given both group and private art instruction to children ages 3-12.&nbsp; She graduated Magna Cum Laude from Northland College in Ashland, Wisconsin with a self-designed major in Environmental Economics and a Visual Arts minor.&nbsp; Kathleen received her Montessori certificate from the Center for Montessori Teacher Education/NC.</p>
              <p align="justify">Kathleen is an accomplished oil painter and performs in the children&rsquo;s rock band, <em>Baron Von Rumblebuss and Redd Zeppelin</em>.&nbsp; She enjoys painting, studying birds of prey, being outdoors, visiting her place in Northern Wisconsin, and daily living with her son and husband Tray.</p>

              <p>Tina discovered her love for the MCHD community in 2004 when her daughter entered Preschool. A stay-at-home mom at the time, she found that the Montessori philosophy rang true to her family. To spend more time in the Montessori environment, she became part of the lunch and substitute staff, and found herself intrigued with the Montessori approach to using language with children, and the importance of one&rsquo;s own joy in completing a task. Tina subsequently accepted the position of LHAS Elementary instructor. In 2005, she became a LHAS Early Childhood instructor and subsequently served as the  Director of After School programs for over six years. Tina was delighted in 2012 to be moving back into the classroom to work  with children again. Tina attended East Carolina University and received her degree as a Professional Massage Therapist and Natural Health Educator from Twin Lakes College of the Healing Arts in Santa Cruz, CA.</p>

              <p>Robin started teaching in the field of special education in 1984 and has taught at all grade levels. She has worked in three states and overseas for the Department of Defense Dependent Schools. She began Montessori teaching as a substitute at the prestigious Barrie School in Maryland and went on to earn her Preschool teaching certificate there (in the same class as our own Amy Nelson). At Barrie, she was asked to set up their second Toddler classroom, and Robin discovered her affinity for this age child. She completed her Infant/Toddler certification at Barrie in June 2012, having done her internship at Montessori Community School in Durham. She joined the MCHD later in 2012 to open our second Toddler classroom. Robin sews, reads, and gardens in her spare time, sings in an adult choir, and quite incidentally bought a house in the neighborhood next to the new campus when she moved to Durham two years ago! She and her husband, Craig, have two children. </p>
