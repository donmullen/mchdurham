          <p>A non-refundable $100 application fee is required for your application to be complete.</p>

          <h5>Acceptance Fee</h5>
          <p>The Acceptance Fee, $1500, is a non-refundable payment due when a student accepts an offer of admission. The Acceptance Fee is discounted to $750 for siblings, <em>if </em>the first child enrolled at MCHD is still at MCHD or if the first child has graduated from 6th grade at MCHD, and so long as the parents' account with the school is in good standing.</p>

            <h4>Financial Aid for the 2013-2014 school year</h4>
            <p>The Financial Aid Fund was created to make it possible for children of varied economic resources to attend MCHD. It is a goal of our school to provide an educational environment that reflects a cross-section of the larger society in which we live.</p>
            <p align="justify">All current and prospective MCHD families are eligible to apply for aid to assist with MCHD tuition. Financial aid does not apply to fees. Application for assistance in no way affects the admission decision. All applications are kept confidential, and are identified only by a numerical code. If you would like to be considered for financial aid, please apply at the same time you apply to MCHD, so that if possible we can notify you of your award when we offer you admission.</p>
            <h5>How to Apply for Financial Aid</h5>
            <p>Applicants&rsquo; information is processed and standardized by Tuition Aid Data Services (TADS), so that we can make equitable comparisons of need.</p>
            <img src="http://mchdurham.org/images/photo_vt_04.jpg" width="174" height="258" align="left" />
            <p>For new admissions, please have applications and supporting materials submitted to TADS by January 15th to be considered in the first round of admissions. Later applications <strong>can</strong> be accepted for later rounds of admissions.</p>
            <p align="justify">Applications and supporting materials will be due to TADS by January 7, 2013 for returning families.</p>
            <p align="justify">We encourage you to fill out the TADS forms online, as this speeds the process. Go to <a href="http://www.tuitionaid.com/">www.mytads.com</a>. There is an Application Wizard to help you, and additional help at <a href="mailto:support@tadsweb.com">support@tads.com</a> and toll-free at 1-800-884-8237. If you would like a paper application, call TADS at 1-800-477-8237.</p>
            <p align="justify">There is a fee ($34) payable to TADS to apply; if paying by check, make it payable and send directly to TADS. If you are made and accept a financial aid award, the fee will be refunded by MCHD after enrollment. </p>
            <p align="justify">TADS will require that you submit to them some supporting documentation: copies of your most recent W-2 and/or 1099, most recent paystub, most recent federal tax return, most recent corporate tax return, if applicable, and documentation of all other sources of income, such as social security income (see the website or application for further details). These can be faxed to TADS at (612) 548-3326, or mailed.</p>

            <p align="justify">You can order an optional Parent Report for $8.00 after completing your application, which merely summarizes the information you gave to TADS. The same information, however, is available for free online.</p>
            <p align="justify">All award decisions are made by MCHD. You will receive notice about your award from MCHD, not TADS.</p>
            <p align="justify">In cases where divorced, separated, or never married parents are both contributing to the support of the child, both must fill in an application, or fill it in jointly. If tuition is paid all or in part by someone else (e.g. grandparent), these payments MUST be reported on the application in the section for Contributions in Education.</p>

            <h4>Replacement Program</h4>
            <p><img src="http://mchdurham.org/images/photo_hz_04.jpg" width="264" height="168" align="left" />When families enroll at MCHD, they sign a Tuition Agreement that represents a contract to pay tuition for the entire year, even if the child is unable to attend school for any reason. Because we know that life has a way of bringing unexpected circumstances, such as a job offer in another state, we offer a Replacement Program to assist families in these situations.</p>
            <p>At any time during the school year, a parent may request that the school try to find a suitable student to replace their child's Tuition Agreement. To participate in this Replacement Program and initiate the search for a new student, a parent must submit a formal application and a $550 Replacement Fee. The Replacement Fee offsets the costs associated with the school&rsquo;s efforts to find a new student to replace the departing student. All admission and enrollment decisions for the new student will follow MCHD's normal procedures. MCHD and Little House After School have separate replacement programs. A fee of $150 is required to replace a Little House After School contract.</p>
            <p>Until a Tuition Agreement is replaced, parents are obligated to continue to pay tuition on the normal payment schedule. Replacement occurs when the school receives a signed tuition contract for a newly enrolled student at the same program level after that level is full. If a replacement is found, the parents will no longer be obligated for tuition in excess of the amount due as prorated to the school year remaining when the new student begins. If a tuition refund is due to the parents, it will be forwarded when replacement occurs. </p>

            <h4>Frequently Asked Questions</h4>
            <h5>What are the payment plan options for Tuition?</h5>
            <p>Families can choose to pay tuition monthly over ten months from July 1 to April 1, or semiannually July 1 and December 1, or in one annual sum due July 1. Tuition is due on the first of the month; late fees are accrued after the fifth of the month. If your child is accepted after the start of the tuition payment year (July 1), this schedule may be adjusted.</p>
            <h5>Will I get a bill every month?</h5>
            <p>At the end of the month, families will receive a statement of tuition due for the first of the following month. This will outline any other fees for enrichments, drop-in care, or other amounts not included in regular tuition. </p>
            <h5>Can I pay MCHD tuition and After School care tuition together?</h5>
            <p>Yes, they can be paid with one check or bank draft, and both will be shown on your Tuition Statement.</p>
            <h5>Can I have tuition and fees drafted from my bank account?</h5>
            <p>Yes, tuition can be drafted from your account if you choose the monthly payment option. Additional fees for No School Camps, Enrichments, and other fees will appear on your monthly statement but can&rsquo;t be drafted, as they change from month to month.</p>
            <h5>I can use benefit credits at work for childcare expenses. How do I get a receipt?</h5>
            <p>The Business Office can generate a receipt for tuition at your request.</p>
            <h5>We signed a Tuition Agreement but now our family situation has changed and we need a release from our Tuition Agreement. How would we do this?</h5>
            <p>When families enroll at MCHD, they sign a Tuition Agreement that represents a contract to pay tuition for the entire year, even if the child is unable to attend school for any reason. Because we know that life has a way of bringing unexpected circumstances, such as a job offer in another state, we offer a Replacement Program to assist families in these situations. At any time during the school year, a parent may request that the school try to find a suitable student to replace their child's Tuition Agreement.
