          <div class="content" data-slug="classroom" data-section-content>
              <p>We offer academic programs for children ages 18 months through Elementary Grade 6. We are proud to be the first Montessori school in North Carolina to be Accredited by the <a href="http://www.amshq.org/" target="_blank">American Montessori Society</a>. </p>
              <p>The foundation of the Montessori classroom is the prepared environment and the uninterrupted work cycle. Our teachers create a classroom in which children are taught the skills they need to be successful, and the materials, furniture, and layout itself also foster the child&rsquo;s ability to be independent. During the extended periods of work during the day, a student is able to delve deeply into her learning, satisfying her interest in the acquisition of a particular bit of knowledge or skill (her &ldquo;sensitive period&rdquo;). Simultaneously, her powers of concentration are developed and extended. </p>
              <p>The Directress and the prepared environment also set the limits and ground rules that teach a child to take on his responsibility to himself and to the community in which he exists. Within limits and responsibility, freedom is possible. The role of the teacher in the Montessori classroom is to observe the child and direct him or her to the lesson or material appropriate for him or her at that moment. The school&rsquo;s faculty bring enthusiasm, loving energy, and respect for children to their classrooms every day. Lead teachers are certified in one of the training programs approved by the American Montessori Society. The teachers work to involve parents by holding parent education nights, preparing for parent-teacher conferences, and soliciting and welcoming parents&rsquo; observations and volunteer work.</p>
              <p>Classes are comprised of children of mixed ages, which permits deepening understanding and skill acquired through repetition and extension, allows children to follow their highly individual course of development, and offers the fruitful interaction of older and younger students. The multi-age grouping is essential to the Montessori classroom&rsquo;s success because it allows each child an opportunity to explore subjects on a variety of levels, and promotes collaborative learning rather than competition.</p>

            <h3>Toddler</h3><p>Ages 18  months - 3 years old &nbsp;|&nbsp; Monday - Friday, 9:00 am - 12:00 pm</p>
            <p><img src="http://mchdurham.org/images/photo_vt_05.jpg" width="174" height="258" align="left" />The Toddler program runs Monday through Friday, 9:00 am to 12:00 pm. (with a 15-minute drop-off and pick-up window on either end). Before School care is available from 8:20 am.</p>
            <p>A Montessori-certified teacher and an assistant lead the class of 12 students (6:1 student-teacher ratio). The teachers follow the approved American Montessori Society curriculum for this age group, in keeping with our standing as an AMS Accredited school.</p>
              <p>Each year begins with an orientation period that allows for a smooth transition away from a primary caregiver into what is often the child&rsquo;s first community of peers. The environment is rich with materials to stimulate conversation and the development of language, with manipulatives, pre-math materials, science and nature exploration, and activities for sensory exploration and gross motor development. Children are introduced to art and music from various cultures and have many opportunities for creative expression. Practical life skills relate to care of self and the environment, including toilet learning. Activities often are multi-dimensional: work washing a table, for example, involves both large and fine motor skills, memory recall, logical sequencing of steps, and vocabulary building.</p>
                <p>The large, sunny Toddler classrooms are filled with materials and activities suitable for children of this age. In following the Montessori curriculum, children will engage in materials and activities to develop gross and fine motor and communication skills, as well as order, concentration, cooperation, and independence. As with all our classes, music, snack, and outdoor playtime is a part of every day.</p>
                <p>It is not necessary for your child to be independently toileting before starting the Toddler program. With its integrated toddler-sized bathroom, this setting will help your child toward independence.</p>
                <p>At this time we are not able to offer after-school care to the Toddler class. A five-day program is the only option offered.</p>

              <h3>Ages 3-4</h3>
              <p>Monday - Friday, 8:30 am - 12:00 pm</p>
              <p><img src="http://mchdurham.org/images/photo_sq_05.jpg" width="214" height="208" align="left" />MCHD&rsquo;s preschool program includes children ages 3 through 6. Each classroom is comprised of 22 students, balanced according to age and gender, with children remaining in the same classroom for the three-year cycle. The school day runs from 8:30am to 12:00pm, Monday through Friday, for pre-Kindergarten children. In the third year, children in Extended Day (Kindergarten) stay for lunch and return to the classroom until 2:30 for additional lessons. See <a href="curriculum.html#extended">Extended Day</a> for more information on this program. </p>
              <p>At the beginning of each academic year new students are given a two-week orientation period. This orientation period of abbreviated school days and a lower student-teacher ratio allows the children to become familiar with the classroom routines and teachers and comfortable separating from their parents. </p>
              <p>Children at this age learn best by exploring, absorbing knowledge through their hands and senses. They concentrate best where there is routine, beauty, and freedom within order. Our classrooms are designed for them to make choices and work  without interruption, with a rich array of materials for their exploration. </p>

              <h3>Age 5</h3><p>Monday - Friday, 8:30 am - 2:30 pm</p>
              <p><img src="http://mchdurham.org/images/photo_hz_08.jpg" width="264" height="168" align="left" />Children in Extended Day (Kindergarten) participate in their mixed age classroom with 3 and 4 year-olds in the morning, then enjoy lunch together and return to the classroom for an afternoon of focused instruction and exploration. Extended Day students may be recombined from the three morning classrooms for the afternoon program, giving them a chance to excercise the burgeoning social development characteristic of this age group. Most Extended Day classes are comprised of 7-14 children with one or two teachers in the afternoon.</p>
              <p>The curriculum builds upon the standard preschool curriculum by emphasizing the development of skills in writing, mathematics, and reading, as well as the strengthening of practical life skills. The Extended Day program is both the pinnacle of the preschool program and the foundation of the Elementary curriculum.</p>

            <h3>Grades 1-3</h3><p>Monday-Friday 8:20 am - 3:00 pm</p>
            <p><img src="http://mchdurham.org/images/photo_vt_02.jpg" width="174" height="258" align="left" />MCHD&rsquo;s Lower Elementary program is comprised of children in grades 1-3. Each classroom has up to 20 students, balanced according to age and gender. Classes run from 8:20 a.m. to 3:00 p.m., Monday through Friday, with an hour break at noon for lunch and outdoor play. Characteristic of the Montessori model, students remain in the same classroom for three consecutive years.</p>
            <p>The younger Elementary student is beginning to move from the concrete to abstraction, and from a limited world view to inquiry into the big questions of life, with a curiosity about time, human relationships, and the variety and splendor of the world. The &ldquo;Great Lessons&rdquo; in biology, history, astronomy, botany, zoology, and evolution satisfy this curiosity, and form the backbone of the curriculum at this age. Work in mathematics, language, geometry, remains experiential. Students get daily exercise in spelling, handwriting, grammar, and computational accuracy. Children begin to take responsibility for their weekly work plan, building judgment, and time-management and resource skills. Traditional academic studies continue to be individually adjusted to the student&rsquo;s proficiency and sequenced for uninterrupted progression, providing appropriate activities for both the child who needs extra support and the child who advances rapidly with independence. </p>

              <h3>Grades 4-6</h3><p>Monday - Friday 8:20 am - 3:00 pm</p>
              <p><img src="http://mchdurham.org/images/photo_hz_01.jpg" width="264" height="168" align="left" />Advanced work in mathematics, history and cultural studies, geography, natural science, writing, literature, foreign language, arts, and music build naturally from the Lower Elementary years. Year-long cultural studies units cover ancient civilizations, American history (with a focus on North Carolina), and the study of early humans. The science curriculum cycles through chemistry, human biology, and physical machines over the three-year period.</p>
              <p>Practical life lessons at this level are largely student-directed, and include preparation for artistic performances, cooking and planning for events, or organizing fundraisers for the annual class trips. Social mores and rituals are of increasing interest to the preadolescent and are reinforced by the character values curriculum. An expectation of community service affirms the sense of social interdependence emerging at this age. Students in this class collectively create a respectful, self-reliant community.</p>
              <p>Classroom work centers on projects, research, writing, and hands-on activities that can be individualized for maximum student success. Assignments at this level often include a wider range of creative choices in how to present material, furthering the student&rsquo;s capability as a self-directed learner, an attribute Montessori children carry with them throughout life. Sixth grade culminates in a year-long Independent Project, with guidance from teachers in advanced research and presentation skills.</p>
              <p>Regular assessment is carried out by both students and teachers, and a nationally-normed, standardized test is taken by all students at this level each year.</p>

              <h3>Art</h3>
              <p><img src="http://mchdurham.org/images/photo_hz_03.jpg" width="264" height="168" align="left" />Without question, our school has one of the most exceptional art programs available anywhere. Art lessons with our art instructor, Janine Wolf, begin in Extended Day, and Elementary students from grades one through six enjoy weekly art classes. Our campus includes a separate, airy art room with high ceilings, large windows and natural light. Shelves are filled with an array of art materials, trays of art project choices, and wooden work tables.</p>
              <p>Formal art lessons focus on the study of line, shape, color, texture, and form. Students work in a wide variety of materials and learn many artistic techniques and processes. They study the work of famous artists and use it as inspiration for their own personal artwork. <br />
              <p>Art lessons cover a broad range of skills and fundamentals that have applications across  the curriculum, including:</p>

              <ul>
                <li>Drawing with pencils, crayons, pastels, markers, and chalk<br /></li>
                <li>Cutting and gluing</li>
                <li>Painting with watercolors, tempera, acrylic, and ink</li>
                <li>Color Mixing and Color Theory</li>
                <li>Pottery</li>
                <li>Maskmaking</li>
                <li>Printmaking</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Student Artwork is beautifully displayed and celebrated in the art room, the office, and annually at the Durham Public Library. The MCHD Art Program affords each student the opportunity to express him/herself creatively and confidently, and to enjoy art as part of their daily lives.</p>

            <h3>Physical Education</h3>
            <p>In addition to daily outdoor play for every child, we have a weekly program for physical education. Movement or yoga classes are part of Wednesday afternoons in Extended Day. In the Elementary grades, P.E. offerings rotate over the course of the year among swimming and ice skating lessons, cooperative games, team sports, hiking, bowling, and yoga.</p>
            <p>Cooperation and inclusion are two primary goals of our P.E. program for Elementary students. We do not emphasize competitive sports at school at this age, favoring instead competing against one’s own best time at the swim-a-thon, for instance. Activities with student-devised rules and ample opportunities for group problem-solving under adult supervision are also encouraged.</p>
